# Autonomous Highway-Driving in highway-env
In this project I train a virtual agent to efficiently drive through a crowded highway, experimenting with three kinds of Deep Q-Networks: Vanilla DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN. Test performance
is compared against a heuristic baseline and a manually controlled situation.
